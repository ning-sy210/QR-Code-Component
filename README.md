# Frontend Mentor - QR Code Component

This is a solution to the [QR Code Component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). This will also be my first challenge that I am attempting on the platform!

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://react.dev/) (TypeScript)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/)

### What I learned

Since this is the recommended challenge for beginners new to Frontend Mentor, I don't think there's particularly lots to learn. I did get my hands dirty with SASS which is a CSS preprocessor that I found out about and got interested in during my first job.

### Continued development

I would love to learn more about SASS and the features it provides, and I will be using it more often in the future Frontend Mentor challenges.

I look forward to using some of the more advanced hooks that React has to offer, such as `useContext` and `useDispatch`.
